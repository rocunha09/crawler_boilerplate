# crawler_boilerplate
This project is the materialization of a latent need that runs through the day-to-day activities of many companies or their management and technology layers.

With the aim of facilitating and speeding up the construction and execution of crawlers, removing the friction of project setup and thus moving directly to the value layer, which is the construction of the routine itself, this project was created and will be improved and maintained.

The technologies initially chosen are 
* Python;
* Selenium;
* Browsers: Chrome, Firefox, Opera, Edge;
* Mode: simple (local use) and advanced (Provides for the use of the crawler with scalability and cloud deployment.

If you, the user of this project, have any new ideas for improvement or correction, I would be grateful to read the open issues and try to implement them.
